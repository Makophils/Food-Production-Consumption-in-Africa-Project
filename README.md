## Food Production & Consumption Project in Africa(2004-2013)
The goal of this project was to analyze Food production and supply in African countries between 2004 to 2013.
## Gathering the data
The Food production dataset was downloaded [here](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/mar/Hamoye/Session%202/Data/Africa%20Food%20Production%20(2004%20-%202013).csv) while the Food supply dataset was downloaded [here](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/mar/Hamoye/Session%202/Data/Africa%20Food%20Supply%20(2004%20-%202013).csv).The datasets were then read into Jupiter Notebook were the analysis was done.
## Summary of Findings  
The Following insights were uncovered after the analysis:

•	The Top 5 African countries with the highest food production include Nigeria,Egypt, South Africa,Ethiopia and Tanzania.

•	The Top 5 produced Food items include Cassava,Sugar cane ,Maize ,Yam and Vegetables.

•	There was a significant increase in Food production between 2004 to 2006,after which there was a decline in 2007.A steady increase was seen between 2008 till 2012.

•	Countries with the highest food supply in Africa include Egypt,Tunisia and Moroco while countries with the least supply is Zambia,Ethiopia and Chad. Note that while countries like 
  Nigeria & South Africa were amongst the top 3 food producing Nations,they were not amongst the top 3 Africa countries with the highest food supply.

• While there was an overall increase in food production and supply over the years,food supply can be seen to be well below food production.
